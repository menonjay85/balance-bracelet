This study explores the physiological and psycho
logical benefits of coherent breathing facilitated by a novel
 wearable device, the Balance Bracelet, which utilizes a 6-second
 inhalation and exhalation cycle to optimize synchronization be
tween Heart Rate Variability (HRV) and Respiratory Rate (RR).
 Employing advanced Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, the
 device enables real-time monitoring and feedback, enhancing
 autonomic nervous system balance and promoting emotional
 stability. Preliminary results indicate that regular practice of
 coherent breathing significantly aligns HRV and RR, reducing
 stress responses and improving mental health outcomes. The find
ings underscore the efficacy of integrating controlled breathing
 techniques with wearable technology to support daily wellness
 and resilience against stress, offering significant implications
 for both individuals and clinical practices. This study not only
 contributes to the understanding of biofeedback mechanisms
 in stress management but also highlights the transformative
 potential of wearable health technology in enhancing life quality.
